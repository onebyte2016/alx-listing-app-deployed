# alx-listing-app

# ALX Listing App

A simple Airbnb-style listing application built with Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and ESLint.

## 📌 Project Goals

To scaffold the foundational structure of a clean, scalable, and modular Next.js application, including reusable UI components and a focus on best practices for styling and type safety.

## 🗂 Folder Structure

- **components/**: Reusable UI elements such as Card and Button.
- **interfaces/**: TypeScript interfaces for props and data models.
- **constants/**: Reusable config values and constants.
- **public/assets/**: Static assets like images and icons.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install



Overview
In this milestone, learners will create a fully functional Booking Detail Page for a listing application. The page will follow the provided mockup design and will allow users to enter contact information, provide payment details, review booking information, and confirm the booking. It will be styled with Tailwind CSS and made responsive for different screen sizes. This implementation simulates a core part of real-world travel and accommodation platforms like Airbnb and Booking.com.

By completing this milestone, learners will gain practical experience in structuring components, handling form input layouts, and presenting order summaries while adhering to modern responsive UI/UX principles.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this milestone, learners should be able to:

Understand and implement component-based architecture in a Next.js project.
Build responsive forms with Tailwind CSS to collect user contact and payment details.
Integrate an order summary section that dynamically displays booking details.
Enhance UX with clear booking information, cancellation policies, and ground rules.
Apply proper folder structuring for scalability and maintainability in a React/Next.js app.
Learning Outcomes
After completing this milestone, learners will be able to:

Develop a Booking Form component with multiple grouped inputs for contact, payment, and billing details.
Create an Order Summary component that calculates and displays booking fees, subtotal, and total cost.
Implement Cancellation Policy and Ground Rules sections for user guidance.
Build responsive layouts using Tailwind’s grid system and utility classes.
Organize project files according to best practices in component architecture.
Key Concepts
Component-Based Architecture – Splitting functionality into small, reusable React components.
Responsive Web Design – Making layouts adapt across devices using Tailwind’s utility classes.
Form Layout & Input Grouping – Structuring forms to collect detailed information in an organized way.
Dynamic Rendering of Data – Passing booking details as props to child components.
Pricing Calculation – Displaying fees and totals in a clear and user-friendly format.
Tools & Libraries
Next.js – For building the booking page and structuring the application.
React – For component-based UI creation.
Tailwind CSS – For styling, responsive design, and layout control.
TypeScript – For type safety and better development experience.
Real-World Use Case
The functionality implemented in this milestone directly mirrors real-world booking platforms like Airbnb, Expedia, and Booking.com. In a live production environment, the booking detail page would:

Validate user input before payment processing.
Integrate with payment gateways for secure transactions.
Display accurate booking summaries fetched from backend APIs.
Show policies and rules to ensure compliance between guests and hosts.
For example, when a customer books a beach villa on Airbnb, they must review the property details, confirm stay dates, enter payment information, and agree to terms—all in one streamlined interface. This milestone builds the front-end foundation for such a process.

mandatory
Objective:

In this milestone, you will implement the Booking Detail Page based on the provided mockup. The page should allow users to enter their contact and payment details, review their booking information, and confirm the booking. This page will be responsive and styled using Tailwind CSS.

By the end of this milestone, you will have created a functional and responsive booking page where users can input details and proceed with the booking process.

Instructions:

Duplicate the Repository:

Duplicate the repository alx-listing-app-00 and rename it to alx-listing-app-03.
Folder Structure: Ensure that the following folder structure exists in your project:

components/booking/BookingForm.tsx

components/booking/OrderSummary.tsx

Create the Booking Page:

In pages/booking/index.tsx, create a static page that renders the booking form and order summary components.
import BookingForm from "@/components/booking/BookingForm";
import OrderSummary from "@/components/booking/OrderSummary";

export default function BookingPage() {
  const bookingDetails = {
    propertyName: "Villa Arrecife Beach House",
    price: 7500,
    bookingFee: 65,
    totalNights: 3,
    startDate: "24 August 2024",
  };

  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto p-6">
      <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6">
        <BookingForm />
        <OrderSummary bookingDetails={bookingDetails} />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}


Implement the Booking Form Component:

In components/booking/BookingForm.tsx, create a form that allows the user to enter the following details:

First Name

Last Name

Email

Phone Number

Payment Information (Card Number, Expiration Date, CVV)

Billing Address (Street Address, Apt/Suite, City, State, Zip Code, Country)

const BookingForm = () => (

    <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Contact Detail</h2>
    <form>
      {/* Contact Information */}

        Confirm & Pay
      </button>
    </form>
  </div>

export default BookingForm;
Implement the Order Summary Component:

In components/booking/OrderSummary.tsx, create a component that displays:

Property name, image, review score.

Stay details (start date, total nights).

Breakdown of fees (booking fee, subtotal, grand total).

const OrderSummary: React.FC<{ bookingDetails: any }> = ({ bookingDetails }) => (
  <div className="bg-white p-6 shadow-md rounded-lg">
    <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Review Order Details</h2>
    <div className="flex items-center mt-4">
      <img src="https://example.com/property.jpg" alt="Property" className="w-32 h-32 object-cover rounded-md" />
      <div className="ml-4">
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">{bookingDetails.propertyName}</h3>
        <p className="text-sm text-gray-500">4.76 (345 reviews)</p>
        <p className="text-sm text-gray-500">{bookingDetails.startDate} • {bookingDetails.totalNights} Nights</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    {/* Price Breakdown */}
    <div className="mt-6">
      <div className="flex justify-between">

        <p>${bookingDetails.bookingFee}</p>
      </div>
      <div className="flex justify-between mt-2">
        <p>Subtotal</p>
        <p>${bookingDetails.price}</p>
      </div>
      <div className="flex justify-between mt-2 font-semibold">
        <p>Grand Total</p>
        <p>${bookingDetails.bookingFee + bookingDetails.price}</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
);

export default OrderSummary;
Add Cancellation Policy and Ground Rules:

Below the form, include a section that outlines:

Cancellation Policy: Display a notice that users can cancel for a full refund before a certain date, and partial refund after that date.

Ground Rules: Display a list of house rules for guests (e.g., “Follow the house rules” and “Treat your Host’s home like your own”).


const CancellationPolicy = () => (
  <div className="mt-6">
    <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Cancellation policy</h2>
    <p className="mt-2 text-gray-600">
      Free cancellation before Aug 23. Cancel before check-in on Aug 24 for a partial refund.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Ground Rules</h2>
    <ul className="mt-2 text-gray-600 list-disc list-inside">
      <li>Follow the house rules</li>
      <li>Treat your Host’s home like your own</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
);

export default CancellationPolicy;
Modify Layout to Include All Sections:

In pages/booking/index.tsx, make sure that the page includes the booking form, order summary, cancellation policy, and ground rules.
